Title: Inference under the lineup protocol
Description: p-value calculation for different scenarios of the lineup
    protocol. For specific lineup sizes (m = 3, 20) theoretical p-values
    are computed for up to K=100 evaluations. Other lineup sizes or more
    evaluations use a simulation approach.
